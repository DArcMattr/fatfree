# Fat-Free Framework

## by Bong Cosca

This is my fork of it, the only thing I've got changed is commenting out the
bit of code that tears off terminating slashes in URLs. A framework should
provide a mechanism, not dictate policy.

I merge in changes from upstream as often as I have time to do so, and as long
as those changes don't break existing functionality.
